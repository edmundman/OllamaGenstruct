"The p-value is used in the context of null hypothesis testing in order to quantify the statistical significance of a result, the result being the observed value of the chosen statistic T. The lower the p-value is, the lower the probability of getting that result if the null hypothesis were true. A result is said to be statistically significant if it allows us to reject the null hypothesis. All other things being equal, smaller p-values are taken as stronger evidence against the null hypothesis.", p-value 
" Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on building applications that learn from data and improve their accuracy over time without being explicitly programmed to do so. In machine learning, algorithms are used to find patterns in data and make better decisions in the future based on the examples they were exposed to.", Machine learning
" Neural networks are a series of algorithms that mimic the operations of a human brain to recognize relationships between vast amounts of data. They are used in a variety of applications, ranging from simple tasks like recognizing handwriting to complex ones like detecting fraudulent transactions. Neural networks rely on training data to learn and improved their accuracy over time.",Neural Networks
